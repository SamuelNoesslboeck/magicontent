This library contains useful functions, definitions and more when working with the [MagicBox](https://github.com/SamuelNoesslboeck/MagicBox).

## Examples and Pre-Made programs

Pre-made programs for direct use and other useful examples can be found in the `examples` folder. Each example has a Platform.IO environment configured with it, so accessing it is simple by e.g.

```sh
pio check -e magicos_basic   # Code check
pio run -e magicos_basic              
```
